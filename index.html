      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <p>In this Big Data and Analytics course at George Washington University, students will embark on an interdisciplinary 
        journey to unlock the potential of large-scale data sets. Leveraging cutting-edge tools and methodologies, 
        the course covers the complete data lifecycle, from data acquisition and storage to analysis and visualization. 
        Designed to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, the course delves into real-world 
        applications, ranging from business decision-making to scientific research. 
        With an emphasis on critical thinking and collaboration, students will leave the course prepared to translate complex 
        data into actionable insights.</p>

      <h2>Course References</h2>
      <p><strong>Required:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>M.L. Rampolla, <em>A Short Guide to Writing in History</em>, 9th Ed. (2014). St. Martinâ€™s Press.  
        ISBN: 0312403577 (or later).  
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Writing-History/dp/1319113028" target="_blank">
          Available on Amazon
        </a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Science, Big Data, and NoSQL books (PDFs and references as provided in class).</li>
        <li>Published papers cited in weekly lecture slides.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>Rampollaâ€™s book contains the rules for writing good term papers. I have used it for over 
        25 years through various editions. When I grade your term papers for spelling, usage, structure, etc., I will be 
        using Rampolla as the key reference. So, I strongly recommend that you buy this book and read it. There is NO excuse 
        for a poorly written paper at the Upper Undergraduate/Graduate Level!</p>

        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from 
                class on their day(s) of religious observance.</li>
            <li>Faculty should extend to these students the courtesy of absence without penalty on such occasions, including 
                permission to make up examinations.</li>
            <li>Faculty who intend to observe a religious holiday should arrange at the beginning of the semester to 
                reschedule missed classes or make other provisions for their course-related activities.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
      <p><strong>Support for Students Outside the Classroom</strong>
        <br>
        Students can schedule meetings to get a consultation during weekdays and weekends.
    </p>
      <p><strong>Disability Support Services (DSS)</strong>
        <br>
        Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability 
        Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable 
        accommodations. For additional information please refer to: 
        <a href="https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/">disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/</a>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p><strong>Academic Integrity Code</strong>
        <br>
        Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the 
        work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For 
        the remainder of the code, see: 
        <a href="https://students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity">students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity/</a>.
        <br>
        It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you 
        achieve that.
    </p>
    <p><strong>You must:</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Do your best to solve all homework, quizzes, and exams on your own.</li>
            <li>Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your main file 
                (subject to the constraints below).</li>
            <li>Notify me if you are using a tutor (this is not a problem, just let me know).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>You may:</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss general approaches to solving homework problems with other students.</li>
            <li>Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming 
                error.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>You may not:</strong>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.</li>
            <li>Have someone else write code for you.</li>
            <li>Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. 
                This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.</li>
            <li>Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versionsâ€”if you are working together 
                with someone to solve a problem, each of you should be writing up your own independent solution.</li>
      </ul>

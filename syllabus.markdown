## Course Description
In this Big Data and Analytics course at George Washington University, students will embark on an interdisciplinary journey to unlock the potential of large-scale data sets. Leveraging cutting-edge tools and methodologies, the course covers the complete data lifecycle, from data acquisition and storage to analysis and visualization. Designed to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, the course delves into real-world applications, ranging from business decision-making to scientific research. With an emphasis on critical thinking and collaboration, students will leave the course prepared to translate complex data into actionable insights.

## Course Objectives
- **Data Comprehension:** Equip students with the skills to identify, interpret, and analyze large datasets, understanding their structure, limitations, and potential uses.
- **Tool Proficiency:** Familiarize students with leading big data tools and technologies, such as Hadoop, S3 Bucket, and various data storage solutions.
- **Analytical Methods:** Introduce key algorithms and statistical methods essential for data analysis, including machine learning techniques and predictive analytics.
- **Data Ethics:** Instill a strong understanding of ethical considerations in data collection, storage, and analysis, including issues of privacy, bias, and data integrity.
- **Real-world Applications:** Engage students in case studies and projects that simulate real-world challenges, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice.
- **Collaborative Skills:** Promote teamwork and interdisciplinary thinking through group projects and discussions, preparing students for collaborative roles in a professional setting.
- **Communication:** Develop students’ ability to effectively convey their findings, both written and orally and to translate complex data analytics into understandable insights for a broader audience.
- **Critical Thinking:** Encourage students to think critically about data, questioning its sources, relevance, and potential impacts when making analytical decisions.

## Prerequisites
- CSCI 6212 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)  
- CSCI 3411 (Operating Systems)

## Course References
**Required**  
- M.L. Rampolla, *A Short Guide to Writing in History*, 9th Ed. (2014). St. Martin’s Press. ISBN: 0312403577 (or later). [Available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Guide-Writing-History/dp/1319113028)  

**Optional**  
- Data Science, Big Data, and NoSQL references (provided in class).  
- Published papers from lecture slides.  

> **Note:** Rampolla’s book contains the rules for writing good term papers. I have used it for over 25 years through various editions. When I grade your term papers for spelling, usage, structure, etc., I will be using Rampolla as the key reference. So, I strongly recommend that you buy this book and read it. There is NO excuse for a poorly written paper at the Upper Undergraduate/Graduate Level!

## Grading Breakdown
- **25%** – Project Milestones Outcome  
- **20%** – Programming Assignments (approx. 2–3)  
- **45%** – Final Project  
- **10%** – Class Participation  

---

## Assignments
- **Programming Load:**  
  Students can use a wide range of languages such as C#, Java, Python, etc. to write code for assignments. Also, the course will make use of several cloud services that typically involve Linux – you should be familiar with the command line and basic Linux administration. 

- **Quizzes and Exams:**  
  Some weeks there will be a quiz based on the taught topics.

- **Final Project:**  
  Final projects can be done in small groups. Students will be required to design, implement and assess a cloud-based and distributed systems that are utilized for Big Data platforms and applications.

## University Policies

### Religious Holidays
1. Students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance.
2. Faculty should extend to these students the courtesy of absence without penalty on such occasions,
including permission to make up examinations.
3. Faculty who intend to observe a religious holiday should arrange at the beginning of the semester to
reschedule missed classes or make other provisions for their course-related activities.

### Support for Students
Students can schedule meetings to get a consultation during weekdays and weekends.

### Disability Support Services (DSS)
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information please refer to:   [disabilitysupport.gwu.edu](https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/)  

### Mental Health Services
- Phone: **202-994-5300** (24/7)  
- The University's Mental Health Services offers 24/7 assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and referrals. [Counseling Center](https://healthcenter.gwu.edu/counseling-and-psychological-services)  

### Academic Integrity Code
Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For the remainder of the code, see: [Full Code](https://students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity)

It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

**You must:**  
- Do your best to solve all homework, quizzes, and exams on your own.
- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your main file (subject to the constraints below).
- Notify me if you are using a tutor (this is not a problem, just let me know).


**You may:**  
- Discuss general approaches to solving homework problems with other students.
- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.

**You may not:**  
- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.
- Have someone else write code for you.
- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.
- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions—if you are working together with someone to solve a problem, each of you should be writing up your own independent solution.

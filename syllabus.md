## University Policies

### University Policy on Religious Holidays
1. Students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance.
2. Faculty should extend to these students the courtesy of absence without penalty on such occasions,
including permission to make up examinations.
3. Faculty who intend to observe a religious holiday should arrange at the beginning of the semester to
reschedule missed classes or make other provisions for their course-related activities.

### Support for Students
Students can schedule meetings to get a consultation during weekdays and weekends.

### Disability Support Services (DSS)
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information please refer to:   [disabilitysupport.gwu.edu](https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/)  

### Mental Health Services
- Phone: **202-994-5300** (24/7)  
- The University's Mental Health Services offers 24/7 assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and referrals. [Counseling Center](https://healthcenter.gwu.edu/counseling-and-psychological-services)  

### Academic Integrity Code
Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For the remainder of the code, see: [Full Code](https://students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity)

It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

**You must:**  
- Do your best to solve all homework, quizzes, and exams on your own.
- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your main file (subject to the constraints below).
- Notify me if you are using a tutor (this is not a problem, just let me know).


**You may:**  
- Discuss general approaches to solving homework problems with other students.
- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.

**You may not:**  
- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.
- Have someone else write code for you.
- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.
- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions—if you are working together with someone to solve a problem, each of you should be writing up your own independent solution.
